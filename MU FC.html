        <p><b>Manchester United Football Club </b> is a commercial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">football</a>  club based in Old Trafford,
            Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football.
            Nicknamed the <b> Red Devils</b>, the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878,
            but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its current stadium,
            Old Trafford, in 1910.</p>

        <p> Manchester United have won the joint-record number of trophies in English club football,[5][6]
            including a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields.

            They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League,
            the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and
            FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the
            club's
            players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European
            Cup.
            Alex
            Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13
            league
            titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions League titles, between 1986 and 2013.[7][8][9] In the 1998–99
            season,
            under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the European
            treble
            of
            the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José
            Mourinho
            in 2016–17, the most recent trophy won by the club, they also became one of five clubs to have won the
            original
            three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League,
            Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).</p>

        <h2> Early years (1878–1945)</h2>

        <p> article: History of Manchester United F.C. (1878–1945)</p>
        <p> United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and

            Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16]
            The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on
            20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway
            company –
            green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had
            become
            a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league.</p>
